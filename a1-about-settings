Static files or assets: CSS stylesheets, JS files, fonts, images.
- no processing involved, just served up as is.
Media files or assets: These are files that a user uploads.

STATIC_URL 
- prefix or URL prepended to static files 
- used by templates static method .
- URL where the user can access your static files from in the browser. 
- The default is /static/, which means 
- your files will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/ 
- in development mode -- e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/css/main.css.
eg:
settings.py: STATIC_URL = '/static/' &
html: <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'app/css/style.css' %}" >
checks the URL in terminal '/static/app/css/style.css'
- "GET /static/app/css/style.css HTTP/1.1" 404 1816

STATICFILES_DIRS: app level
By default, static files are stored at the app-level at <APP_NAME>/static/. 
You can also tell Django to look for static files in additional locations with STATICFILES_DIRS.
In development mode — python manage.py runserver — 

By default -
- django tries to find the static file in folders listed in the STATICFILES_DIRS setting.
- django looks into the first template and static folder inside the app level
- django looks in the static folder of every installed application in the project. 
- always prefix the application name in the subfolders

In case of failure to find (in) STATICFILES_DIRS, 
- Django searches static files in folders listed in STATICFILES_FINDERS setting. 
- using django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder,

STATIC_ROOT 
In production, must run 'python manage.py collectstatic'
- it will find all static files in app level STATICFILES_DIRS and copy them into this directory (BASE_DIR /'staticfiles').
- the absolute path to the directory where your Django application will serve your static files from. 
- static files are deployed in STATIC_ROOT directory or location

STATIC_URL = '/static/'  
# STATIC_ROOT = (BASE_DIR /'staticfiles')
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
# STATICFILES_DIRS = [BASE_DIR / 'app/static']
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
